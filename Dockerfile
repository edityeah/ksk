# Single-container KSK build. The Express server in server/src/index.js
# already serves /api/* AND the built SPA from web/dist when NODE_ENV is
# production (see server/src/index.js lines ~104+), so a single Node
# process behind Cloudflare tunnel is all we need — no separate nginx
# container, no CORS plumbing.
#
# Stages:
#   build  — install deps + prisma generate + vite build the SPA
#   runtime — alpine + node + the built workspace (no dev tooling)
